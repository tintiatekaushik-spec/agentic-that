# Telegram Workflow Dashboard

This project is a local Node.js/TypeScript application for connecting one or more Telegram user accounts, sending messages from the selected account, saving workflow data in the browser workspace, and storing Telegram sessions/messages securely in an encrypted local JSON datastore.

The current flow:

```text
Developer runs npm run server
-> Node.js serves the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8787
-> User opens the dashboard in a browser
-> User signs in with the configured local username/password
-> User enters a Telegram phone number
-> Telegram sends an OTP/login code to that Telegram account
-> User enters the OTP in this dashboard
-> The app stores the encrypted Telegram session in data/store.json
-> Future sends use the selected saved Telegram account/session
```

Each user enters their own Telegram API ID and API Hash when connecting a number. Those credentials and the Telegram session are encrypted in `data/store.json`, so one phone number is never reused as another sender.

No PostgreSQL, Supabase, pgAdmin, or separate database server is required. Backend data is stored in the local encrypted JSON datastore at `data/store.json`. The application UI opens in the browser, while VS Code is only used for editing/running the project.

## What You Can Do

- Create a private browser dashboard account or sign in to an existing one.
- Connect Telegram phone numbers with verification code and optional Telegram 2FA password.
- Select which connected profile/number should send messages.
- Send quick messages to `@username` or `+countrycode` phone numbers.
- Manage local profiles, contacts, inbox threads, groups, channels, posts, search, settings, and backup JSON.
- Create, preview, save, send, and schedule posts from the browser workspace.
- Record sent-post history in browser JSON and backend message history in the JSON datastore.
- Run a separate listener worker to save incoming Telegram replies.
- Run an optional Telegram Bot API auto-reply worker.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- npm.

- Each user needs their own Telegram API ID and API Hash from `https://my.telegram.org` when connecting a number.
- A real Telegram phone number for each account you want to connect.
- For production use: HTTPS, a real auth system, secret manager, backups, monitoring, and network restrictions.
- Go to `https://my.telegram.org`, enter your mobile number, paste the Telegram code, open API development, create an app, and copy the API ID and API hash. Enter those values on the dashboard Add Number screen.
- For SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY and USER_PROVISIONING_KEY, run this `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"` 2 times a random key will be generated paste them in their respective places

## First-Time Local Setup

### 1. Install Packages

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Prepare the JSON Datastore

No external database setup is required. The backend creates `data/store.json` automatically on first startup.

The JSON datastore contains encrypted Telegram sessions, encrypted message history, app users, browser sessions, and temporary Telegram login challenges. Keep `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` stable because changing it makes existing encrypted Telegram sessions/messages unreadable.

### 3. Create `.env`.

Copy the example file:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate two different private keys:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"
```

Run the command twice. Put the first value in `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and the second value in `USER_PROVISIONING_KEY`.

Fill `.env` like this:

```env
DATA_DIR=data
SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=generated_key_1
USER_PROVISIONING_KEY=generated_key_2
SERVICE_HOST=127.0.0.1
SERVICE_PORT=8787
```

Never commit or share `.env`, access tokens, Telegram login codes, 2FA passwords, bot tokens, session strings, or generated keys. Users should keep their own Telegram API hash private.

### 4. Start the API and Browser UI

```bash
npm run server
```

Expected output:

```text
Telegram multi-users API listening on http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

### 5. Create Your Workspace

Open the dashboard and click `Create account` with your own username and password. Each created account has its own connected Telegram numbers, sessions, and message history.

You can also set `AUTH_CONFIG_PATH` to point at an optional JSON login file for private/internal deployments.

### 6. Connect a Telegram Number

In the dashboard:

1. Open `Add Number`.
2. Enter the Telegram phone number with country code, for example `+91XXXXXXXXXX`.
3. Submit the Telegram verification code sent by Telegram.
4. If prompted, enter that Telegram account's 2FA password.
5. Select the connected profile from the top `Profile` selector.

The selected profile controls the sender for quick messages, inbox replies, and post sending.

### 7. Optional: Start Incoming Message Listening

Open a second terminal:

```bash
npm run listen
```

This starts one Telegram listener for each account already connected when the worker starts. Restart it after adding a new Telegram number.

## Daily Local Workflow

From the AgenticThat repository root, one command starts the website/WhatsApp,
Telegram, and Instagram services together:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The launcher selects free ports, prints every local URL, and stops all services
together when you press `Ctrl+C`. Telegram background listeners are started by
the Telegram API service, so a second terminal is not required.

Default local URLs:

```text
Website + WhatsApp: http://127.0.0.1:5173
Telegram:           http://127.0.0.1:8787/console
Instagram:          http://127.0.0.1:5173/scraper/instagram
```

The app does not open inside VS Code. VS Code is only the editor/terminal. The dashboard itself opens in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or another browser.

If frontend files changed, the Next.js development server reloads them automatically.

## GitHub Handoff Workflow

When pushing this project to GitHub, commit the code and templates, but never commit local secrets or stored Telegram sessions.

Safe to commit:

```text
src/
public/
config/
docs/
package.json
package-lock.json
README.md
.env.example
tsconfig.json
```

Do not commit:

```text
.env
data/store.json
node_modules/
logs/
```

These local files are ignored by `.gitignore`. `data/store.json` contains encrypted Telegram sessions and should stay private to the machine/user that connected those Telegram accounts.

A new developer should run:

```bash
git clone YOUR_REPO_URL
cd contact-telegram
npm install
```

Then copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill Telegram API credentials and generated keys, run the app, and open the browser URL:

```bash
npm run server
```

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

Because `data/store.json` is not pushed, the new developer starts with a fresh datastore and must connect their own Telegram number with OTP.

## Browser Dashboard Guide

### Dashboard

Shows a summary of connected numbers, contacts, groups, channels, posts, and the currently selected profile.

### Add Number

Connects a Telegram phone number. The backend sends the Telegram code request, stores the temporary login challenge encrypted, and saves the final session encrypted in the JSON datastore.

### Manage Numbers

Lists connected Telegram accounts. You can search, filter, refresh, or delete a connected account. Deleting removes the local account record and attempts to revoke the Telegram session.

### Profiles

Stores local profile metadata such as profile name, display name, username, phone, avatar/image URL, status, description, and config numbers.

Profile metadata is browser localStorage JSON. Telegram sessions are not stored in the browser.

### Applications

Shows the current Telegram workflow and placeholder slots for later workflow modules.

### Contacts

Stores local contact records with name, Telegram username, phone number, group label, and notes.

Supported recipient formats:

```text
@telegram_username
+91XXXXXXXXXX
```

Contacts can be added, edited, deleted, searched, exported as JSON, and imported from JSON.

### Inbox

Shows saved contacts and backend message history for the selected Telegram account. Use `npm run listen` to save incoming Telegram replies. The inbox can send replies to a selected contact when that contact has a username or phone number.

### Groups

Stores local broadcast-list style groups. Each group can have one recipient per line:

```text
@member_username
+91XXXXXXXXXX
```

When selected in Post Manager, the app sends to each saved group member one by one. This is not yet private Telegram group sync by `chatId` or `accessHash`.

### Channels

Stores local channel/invite notes for workflow planning. Channel records are local browser JSON and do not currently sync Telegram channel membership.

### Post Manager

Create and manage posts with title, type, category, tags, status, schedule date/time, media URL, body/caption, manual target, saved contacts, and saved groups.

Post types include text, image, video, document, audio, voice, link preview, poll text, forwarded style, announcement, campaign, and template style records. Actual Telegram sending supports text plus optional media URL/data URL.

To send:

1. Select the sender profile at the top of the app.
2. Open `Post Manager`.
3. Fill title and body/caption.
4. Optionally add a direct public media URL or supported base64 data URL.
5. Add a manual target, select contacts, select groups, or combine them.
6. Click `Save post`.
7. Check the preview.
8. Click `Post now` or schedule a date/time.

The app combines all targets, removes duplicates, and sends from the currently selected profile.

### Post History

Shows sent, failed, pending, ready, draft, and scheduled post records from browser localStorage. Each send attempt records recipient, contact/group source, delivery status, sent date/time, Telegram message ID when available, and error text when failed.

Backend message history is also stored encrypted in `data/store.json` and exposed through `GET /v1/messages`.

### Search

Searches local profiles, contacts, groups, channels, and posts in the browser workspace.

### Configuration

Stores browser-side workflow settings such as API label, Telegram workflow label, session label, proxy notes, storage label, and theme.

### Backup

Exports/imports browser workspace JSON:

- profiles
- contacts
- groups
- channels
- posts
- post history
- settings

Backups do not include `.env`, `data/store.json`, Telegram session strings, access tokens, or Telegram API credentials.

## Server-Side Data

The backend creates `data/store.json` automatically. It contains JSON arrays equivalent to the old database tables:

- `appUsers`: application users and hashed access tokens.
- `appSessions`: hashed browser session cookies.
- `telegramAccounts`: connected Telegram account metadata and encrypted session strings.
- `telegramLoginChallenges`: encrypted temporary login state.
- `telegramMessages`: encrypted inbound/outbound message records.

Encrypted fields in `data/store.json` use `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Keep this key stable. If it changes, existing encrypted Telegram sessions and messages cannot be decrypted.

## Browser Local Data

The workflow dashboard stores these localStorage keys:

```text
telegramWorkflow:selectedAccount
telegramWorkflow:profiles
telegramWorkflow:contacts
telegramWorkflow:groups
telegramWorkflow:channels
telegramWorkflow:posts
telegramWorkflow:postHistory
telegramWorkflow:settings
```

Use `Backup -> Export backup` before clearing browser data or moving browsers. Back up `data/store.json` separately if you need to preserve connected Telegram sessions and backend message history.

## Login User Configuration

Normal users can create their own workspace from the browser sign-in screen.

Optional static password users can also be read from the first available source:

1. `AUTH_CONFIG_PATH`
2. `config/users.json`
3. `auth.json`

Supported JSON shape:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "team-member",
      "password": "",
      "displayName": "Team Member"
    }
  ]
}
```

For production, replace this with your real authentication layer. Do not expose the provisioning key or raw access tokens to normal users.

## API Reference

All API responses are JSON. Browser endpoints also accept the HTTP-only `app_session` cookie after sign-in. CLI/API callers can use:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
```

### Health

```text
GET /health
```

### Create an App User

Trusted/admin flow only:

```text
POST /v1/users
x-provisioning-key: <USER_PROVISIONING_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "displayName": "New User" }
```

The response returns an `accessToken` once. Store it privately.

### Browser Sign-In

Create a browser account:

```text
POST /v1/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{ "username": "maya", "password": "", "displayName": "Maya" }
```

Username/password:

```text
POST /v1/auth/password
Content-Type: application/json

{ "username": "maya", "password": "" }
```

Access-token bootstrap:

```text
POST /v1/auth/session
Content-Type: application/json

{ "accessToken": "tgr_..." }
```

Sign out:

```text
DELETE /v1/auth/session
```

Current user:

```text
GET /v1/me
```

### Telegram Login

Start login:

```text
POST /v1/telegram/login/start

{ "phone": "+919876543210" }
```

Submit Telegram code:

```text
POST /v1/telegram/login/<challengeId>/code

{ "code": "12345" }
```

If `password_required`, submit Telegram 2FA password:

```text
POST /v1/telegram/login/<challengeId>/password

{ "password": "telegram_2fa_password" }
```

### Accounts

```text
GET    /v1/telegram/accounts
DELETE /v1/telegram/accounts/<accountId>
```

### Messages

Send from an account owned by the signed-in user:

```text
POST /v1/messages
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "accountId": "connected-account-id",
  "recipient": "@telegram_username",
  "message": "Hello",
  "mediaUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "mediaType": "image",
  "firstName": "Optional",
  "lastName": "Contact"
}
```

`recipient` can be:

```text
@telegram_username
+91XXXXXXXXXX
public_group_or_channel_username
```

Phone-number delivery imports the number as a Telegram contact. It can fail if the number is wrong, the person is not on Telegram, or privacy settings block discovery. Prefer usernames when possible.

List message history:

```text
GET /v1/messages?accountId=<accountId>&limit=50
```

The maximum returned limit is capped at 100.

## CLI Helpers

Create/connect a Telegram account from the terminal:

```bash
npm run login -- --token YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Send from a connected account:

```bash
npm run send -- --token YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN --account-id ACCOUNT_ID --recipient @username --message "Hello"
```

Issue a fresh app access token for the user who owns a connected account:

```bash
npm run issue-token -- ACCOUNT_ID
```

Run incoming-message listener:

```bash
npm run listen
```

Type-check TypeScript:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the TypeScript server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Optional Telegram Bot Auto-Reply Worker

This is separate from the connected-phone sender flow.

Connected-phone flow:

```text
Dashboard/API -> user's encrypted Telegram session -> sends as that phone number
```

Bot flow:

```text
Telegram user opens your bot -> bot receives text -> npm run bot replies
```

Create a bot with `@BotFather`, add the token to `.env`, then run:

```bash
npm run bot
```

Saved answers live in [config/bot-answers.json](config/bot-answers.json):

```json
{
  "answers": [
    {
      "keywords": ["price", "pricing", "cost"],
      "answer": "Please share the service or product name so our team can send the correct price."
    }
  ]
}
```

Bot commands:

- `/start`: welcome message.
- `/help`: usage help.
- `/ping`: health check reply.
- `/reload`: reload saved answers from JSON.

If `BOT_RESPONDER_URL` is set, the bot sends each question to that HTTP endpoint and falls back to saved answers if the responder fails or returns no reply.

Responder request shape:

```json
{
  "chatId": 123456,
  "messageId": 10,
  "userId": 999,
  "username": "telegram_user",
  "displayName": "Telegram User",
  "text": "What are your prices?"
}
```

Responder response shape:

```json
{ "reply": "Your answer text" }
```

or:

```json
{ "answer": "Your answer text" }
```

Telegram bots can reply only to users who started the bot or to groups where the bot is added and allowed to read messages.

## Screenshots and Requirements

Screenshots are in [docs/screenshots](docs/screenshots). Requirement coverage and known workflow gaps are tracked in [docs/telegram-workflow-requirements.md](docs/telegram-workflow-requirements.md).

## Current Limitations

- Contacts, groups, channels, posts, settings, and post history are browser-local workspace JSON, not shared server records.
- Contacts and groups are not strictly scoped per selected profile yet.
- Saved groups are local broadcast lists, not private Telegram group sync by `chatId`/`accessHash`.
- Scheduled posts send only while the browser workspace is open and signed in. There is no server-side scheduler worker yet.
- Channel records are local planning records and do not manage Telegram channel membership.
- A dedicated QR Code tab is listed in requirements but is not implemented in the UI yet.
- `npm run listen` loads accounts only at startup. Restart it after adding or deleting numbers.

## Troubleshooting

### Server says an env variable is required

Check `.env` exists in the project root and has every required value. The app loads `.env` automatically from the current working directory.

### `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY must be a base64url-encoded 32-byte key`

Generate a new key:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"
```

Only change this on a fresh datastore. Changing it on existing data makes encrypted sessions/messages unreadable.

### Browser sign-in fails

Check `config/users.json` or the file pointed to by `AUTH_CONFIG_PATH`. The username comparison is case-insensitive. Password comparison is exact.

### Telegram code is invalid or expired

Use the latest code sent by Telegram. If it expired, start the Add Number flow again.

### Message send says recipient cannot be resolved

Use a public `@username` if possible. Phone numbers must include `+countrycode`, and Telegram privacy settings may block phone lookup.

### Media send fails

Use a direct public `http(s)` media URL or a valid base64 data URL. Some hosts block Telegram from downloading files.

### Inbox does not show incoming replies

Run `npm run listen` in a second terminal and restart it after connecting new numbers.

### Port already in use

Change `SERVICE_PORT` in `.env`, then restart `npm run server`.

## Production Checklist

- Replace local JSON login with your real auth/session system.
- Use HTTPS and set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true`.
- Keep `.env` and all secrets in a secret manager.
- Restrict network access to the API.
- Set exact `CORS_ORIGIN` only if the frontend is hosted separately.
- Add backups for `data/store.json` and exported workspace JSON where needed.
- Add monitoring, structured logs, retries, abuse controls, and alerting.
- Respect Telegram rate limits, user consent, privacy rules, and data-retention obligations.
