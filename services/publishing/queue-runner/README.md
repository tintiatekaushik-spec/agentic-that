# Publish Queue Runner

Publish Queue Runner is the local execution service behind AgenticThat's Netlify
publishing dashboard. It supports Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn, and YouTube
through isolated account sessions and fully manual social-account login.
Instagram and LinkedIn use the Companion browser. Facebook, X, and YouTube use
a dedicated normal Chrome, Edge, or Chromium profile because those providers can
reject embedded sign-in; the Companion retains and verifies that profile locally.

Customers use the packaged Windows, macOS, or Linux Companion; they do not run this service or
edit JSON files. The Companion stores queue metadata, media, and account browser
profiles locally. The normal website is the primary interface, and the Companion
claims workspace jobs directly from Supabase. The Chrome extension is optional
and is not required by this flow.

## Customer workflow

1. Install and open the Companion for Windows, macOS, or Linux from the dashboard.
2. Use the AgenticThat website in the normal browser; no extension is required.
3. Add social accounts in Config Manager and choose **Login** for each one.
4. Enter credentials manually in the provider page. Companion detects success,
   protects the session locally, and closes embedded sign-in panes automatically.
   Facebook, X, and YouTube open their saved external Chrome, Edge, or Chromium profile by design.
5. Create a post, choose a normal image or video file, select accounts, and
   publish it now or assign an exact time or reusable schedule template.

No structured folders are required. Media is transferred to the Companion in
safe, size-checked chunks. Content Uploaders can hand finished content and fixed
destinations to Schedulers, who assign timing without changing the content.

## Reliability behavior

- Queue execution is serialized and account concurrency is bounded.
- Posts are marked processing before browser work and retain attempt details.
- Interrupted work is held for review by default to reduce duplicate risk.
- Expired sessions mark the account **Login required** and preserve the post.
- Upload extension, MIME family, size, chunk offsets, and signature are checked.
- Platform UI changes, CAPTCHA, restrictions, or outages surface as recoverable
  failures instead of silent success.
- CAPTCHA, checkpoints, rate-limit responses, and uncertain final clicks pause
  the account for manual review. The final publish action is never blindly
  retried.
- Content pre-flight blocks private or credential-bearing links and accidental
  exact queue duplicates. Spam-like patterns and recent same-account repeats
  require explicit confirmation.
- Reusing the same campaign content across different apps is allowed without a
  duplicate warning.
- Media publishing requires the user to confirm ownership or permission.

## Default account pacing

These are conservative product defaults, not platform guarantees. The limits
are rolling per account and successful posts are separated by a minimum gap.

| App | Standard hourly | Standard daily | Minimum gap |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Instagram | 1 | 6 | 60 minutes |
| Facebook | 2 | 10 | 30 minutes |
| LinkedIn | 1 | 3 | 60 minutes |
| X | 4 | 30 | 15 minutes |
| YouTube video | 1 | 3 | 60 minutes |
| YouTube Community | 2 | 6 | 30 minutes |

Newly connected accounts default to **Protected** pacing: half the hourly and
daily allowance (minimum one) and at least a 60-minute gap. This mode never
rejects an account and can be changed to **Standard** for an established
account. Accounts do not need likes or followers to be connected.

## Safety boundary

No browser publisher can be undetectable or ban-proof. This product uses the
customer's visible local Chromium session, stable profiles, bounded pacing,
manual login, transparent status, and stop-on-risk behavior. It does not use
stealth patches, biometric impersonation, proxy rotation, CAPTCHA bypasses, or
browser flags that hide automation. Customers remain responsible for each
platform's terms and for the content they publish.
