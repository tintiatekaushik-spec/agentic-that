# Publish Queue Runner

Publish Queue Runner is the local execution service behind AgenticThat's Netlify
publishing dashboard. It supports Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn, and YouTube
through isolated Chrome profiles and fully manual social-account login.

Customers use the packaged Windows companion; they do not run this service or
edit JSON files. The companion stores queue metadata and media locally, checks
schedules every minute, and opens a dedicated Chrome profile for each account.
The Chrome extension securely connects the deployed dashboard to that loopback
service.

## Customer workflow

1. Install the Chrome extension and Windows companion from the dashboard.
2. Copy the dashboard credentials shown in the companion.
3. Add social accounts in Config Manager and choose **Login** for each one.
4. Enter credentials manually on the social network's Chrome page.
5. Create a post, choose a normal image or video file, select accounts, and
   publish now or schedule a future time.

No structured folders are required. Media is transferred to the companion in
safe, size-checked chunks. The computer must stay powered on and the companion
must remain running for scheduled publishing.

## Reliability behavior

- Queue execution is serialized and account concurrency is bounded.
- Posts are marked processing before browser work and retain attempt details.
- Interrupted work is held for review by default to reduce duplicate risk.
- Expired sessions mark the account **Login required** and preserve the post.
- Upload extension, MIME family, size, chunk offsets, and signature are checked.
- Platform UI changes, CAPTCHA, restrictions, or outages surface as recoverable
  failures instead of silent success.
