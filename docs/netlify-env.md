## Scopes

If the Netlify plan supports variable scopes:

- Give `NODE_VERSION` and all `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables the **Builds** scope.
- Give all remaining variables the **Functions** scope.
- Using all scopes also works and is simplest when importing the block as an `.env` file.

Variables declared only under `[build.environment]` in `netlify.toml` are not exposed to Functions. `DATA_STORE` is therefore included above even though the repository also supplies its build-time value.

Before deploying a release, run `npm run production:check` against the proposed
Netlify environment. Apply SQL only through the approval-gated database workflow;
ordinary Netlify builds are intentionally read-only.

## Values not to add

These are unused, redundant, local-only, or provider-specific for the current production configuration:

```env
DB_CONNECTOR=
TELEGRAM_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLISH_QUEUE_API_URL=
PUBLISH_QUEUE_API_URL=
PUBLISH_QUEUE_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=
PLATFORM_AUTH_DATA_PATH=
SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS=
```

`DATABASE_URL` is the server-side Postgres connection. The public Supabase URL
and publishable key let Companion call only the granted RLS-protected RPCs.
`SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` stays on Netlify and is used only to put publishing
media in the private `job-artifacts` bucket and issue scoped signed downloads.
Legacy `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` values are
accepted during migration. All Supabase variables and `DATABASE_URL` must point
to the same project.
`CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must decode to exactly 32 bytes; keep it stable after
deployment because changing it makes stored workspace credentials unreadable.
`TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` are entered per connection in Config
Manager when no shared credentials are configured. They may instead be set as
Functions-scoped variables to keep the connection form phone-only for every
workspace. Both modes encrypt the credentials alongside the Telegram session.

`META_APP_SECRET` is required for Embedded Signup token exchange and signed webhook validation. `META_CONFIGURATION_ID` is required for the recommended Embedded Signup/coexistence button. If you intentionally use only the advanced manual Cloud API credential form, the configuration id can be omitted, but the app secret should still be set for webhook validation.

Do not add `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS` in the Netlify UI. The repository excludes only public URLs, provider names, API versions, phone/WABA/app identifiers, and the Embedded Signup configuration id. Real tokens, app secrets, passwords, encryption keys, session cookies, and connection strings remain protected by secret scanning.

## Optional WATI fallback

New workspaces can choose Meta or WATI during WhatsApp onboarding. For WATI,
the workspace owner enters the tenant API URL and access token in the setup
wizard; AgenticThat validates them, generates a workspace-specific webhook
secret, and stores the connection encrypted. Those self-serve connections do
not require global WATI variables in Netlify.

Only add these variables when seeding a legacy/default WATI connection for the
first admin workspace:

```env
WA_PROVIDER=wati
WATI_API_URL=<wati-tenant-api-url>
WATI_ACCESS_TOKEN=<wati-access-token>
WATI_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<new-random-webhook-secret>
```

The WATI webhook URL must include the same tenant secret:

```text
https://<your-netlify-site>.netlify.app/api/webhooks/wati?token=<wati-webhook-secret>
```

Read-only WhatsApp Web monitoring requires a separately deployed Baileys service. Configure its HTTPS URL and shared secret from `/settings`; the archive does not contain a runnable Baileys service. For a legacy environment-configured monitor, the equivalent variables are `BAILEYS_SERVICE_URL` and `BAILEYS_API_SECRET`.

Only add `TELEGRAM_API_URL` when Telegram is hosted as an external service
instead of the included Netlify Function. For publishing, omit both Publish
Queue URL variables. Supabase keeps workspace metadata, durable jobs, leases,
events, results, and private media. The paired Companion keeps browser sessions
and profiles locally and calls Supabase directly. Team members use the website
without a tunnel, extension, or local URL.

## Publish Queue distribution

Interactive social login and browser publishing use the installable desktop
Companion because a request-based Netlify Function cannot own persistent browser
profiles or a continuously running local worker. A Workspace Manager installs and
pairs it once from Connections; other workspace users do not install it. After
downloading the installer for their operating system, the manager runs it once;
Companion can then start at login. Windows and signed macOS builds update from
signed GitHub releases, while Linux upgrades use the newer DEB/RPM or archive.

The Chrome extension is an optional compatibility bridge; core website jobs do
not require it. Keep
`NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLISHING_COMPANION_DOWNLOAD_URL` on `/companion/download`, which
offers the signed Windows Setup, universal macOS DMG, and Linux DEB/RPM/ZIP
assets from the latest release. Do not set either Publish Queue API URL. The Companion
generates and protects its own local credentials and browser sessions; central
workspace publishing remains available to the authorized team. Publishing and
Telegram scheduling are intentionally paused in this release.

## Webhook

Use this Meta webhook callback URL:

```text
https://<your-netlify-site>.netlify.app/api/webhooks/meta
```

Enter the same newly generated value from `META_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` when Meta asks for the verification token.

Subscribe the Meta webhook to both `messages` and `calls`. The `calls` subscription powers the new call log and missed-call alerts.

## Upgrade behavior

Run the database workflow before deploying. It creates the tenant/account,
phone-number, call-log, normalized Telegram/Publishing, authentication-security,
and job-control schema, then verifies every public table has RLS with browser
grants revoked. On Telegram's first request after migration, encrypted legacy
Blob rows are imported idempotently into normalized Supabase tables. Keep the
existing `META_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `META_WABA_ID`, and `META_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` variables
during the first WhatsApp cutover; new workspaces never inherit them.
