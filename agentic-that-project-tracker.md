# Agentic That Core Engine Tracker

## Simple Status - September 7, 2026

### Completed now

- Secured Supabase data and separated every client workspace.
- Added role-based access, team invitations and protected Admin Center MFA.
- Moved Telegram and Publishing state into normalized Supabase tables.
- Made publishing uploads resumable, retry-safe and capable of files up to 2 GB.
- Fixed publishing database timeouts, Telegram saves and paused-account resume.
- Added login abuse limits, email verification and password-reset foundations.
- Built Companion packages for Windows, macOS and Linux.
- Separated database migrations from normal Netlify deployments.
- Restored role-scoped Publishing handoffs and scheduling for Content Uploaders,
  Schedulers, Publishing Viewers and Publishing Managers.

### Do later

- Connect an email provider so verification and reset emails are delivered.
- Add Windows/macOS signing credentials and publish signed stable Companions.
- Upgrade the Netlify plan when real client traffic requires more capacity.
- Finish live testing for every service, OS and multiple clients before full launch.
- Finish WhatsApp live validation.

### Intentionally skipped

- Telegram scheduling is not required.
- Old Telegram accounts will not be migrated; clients connect new accounts.
